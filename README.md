# Stage Diagram Creator
Interactive stage designer for the 'Scooters' stage within the student center at the University of St. Thomas. I created this website to assist me, my co-workers, and management in planning out the stage setups for bands and performers at my University while working as a A/V Technician. The website is helpful for planning the positions and inputs for video and audio equipment on stage. This makes stage diagrams much more clear compared to pen and paper drawings.
